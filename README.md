# Project Title

Just a quick little project I made while practicing Django and backend development.  
This is part of my journey as I learn and improve my skills.

## About the Project

This project is built using Django and includes basic frontend styling with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript.  
I usually focus on the backend side of things and try to keep things simple and clean.  
Each project I make is a way for me to learn something new or reinforce what I already know.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Ashkan — a junior Django developer who recently transitioned from teaching English as a second language to learning backend development.  
I’m currently focused on improving my skills, building projects, and looking for opportunities to work as a backend developer.
