# Recipe-Food

Just a quick little project I made while practicing Django and backend development.
This is part of my journey as I learn and improve my skills.

## About the Project

This project is built using Django and includes basic frontend styling with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and some JavaScript.
I usually focus on the backend side of things and try to keep things simple and clean.
Each project I make is a way for me to learn something new or reinforce what I already know.

This particular project upgrades a recipe book by adding nutritional information for each recipe. It integrates a nutrition API to fetch calorie and macronutrient data based on recipe ingredients, displaying detailed nutritional breakdowns alongside each recipe. Users can also search recipes by nutritional criteria.

## Features

- Recipe management with detailed nutritional analysis
- Integration with external nutrition API for calorie and macronutrient data
- Search recipes by nutritional criteria
- Clean and simple UI with Bootstrap styling

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Django
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- External Nutrition API

This is where I’ll write a small walkthrough or notes on how the project works.
It’s helpful for me later if I come back to the code or if anyone else wants to understand it.
